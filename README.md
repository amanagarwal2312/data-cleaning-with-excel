Cleaned Customer Dataset (Excel) for Data Analysis

I have cleaned the dataset using Microsoft Excel by performing the following steps:

Removed duplicate records to ensure each row represents a unique customer.

Handled missing values by identifying blanks and either filling or removing them based on relevance.

Converted columns like Year_Birth and Customer_Date to proper date formats.

Standardized categorical fields such as Education and Marital_Status for consistency (e.g., correcting inconsistent spellings).

Ensured all numeric fields (e.g., Income, Mnt_Wines, Num_Deals_Purchases) were formatted correctly and free of any text or symbols.

Created a new Age column by calculating the difference between the current year and the year of birth.
